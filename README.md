The first stop to your child's future begins here!

Whether your next home is from finding a new job, getting a new home or planning your childâ€™s future, Wapy Schools is here to ease the stress of juggling many tasks as a parent when finding a suitable school for your children.

Simply enter the location you are interested in via address, zipcode, or city, state, how many results you would like and how far you would like to search. Wapy Schools will return what you're looking for on your search for better education!

## How To Use

With access to the MapQuest interactive map, users will be able to fill out their desired location of where they are looking (Address, City, Street, or Zipcode), the amount of results they want to receive, and the area (mile radius) of their location. Once the queries are submitted, icon pop-ups populate the interactive map of the various schools. Users will be able to click on their desired school and save to their favorites list!

## API Functionality

We used the MapQuest API to generate a list schools within the given search radius. The pop up markers represent those locations. When the user clicks on a chosen pop up, a call is sent to the school digger API. Not every location generated by the MapQuest API can be found in the school digger database, so some results do not return a value. Additionally, the links provided from the school digger API to navigate to the chosen school's website are not functional. This was an issue the school digger developer was working on.

Aaron Maclnnis and Peter Rezanka focused on the functionality and assuring users of the unlimited options of schooling they have access to.
